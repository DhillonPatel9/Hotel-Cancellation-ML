# Hotel Cancellation Machine Learning

---
## Project Description:

---

Efficient capacity management is a critical aspect of success for hotel chains. Unexpected cancellations can disrupt operations, result in revenue losses from underbooking, and cause customer dissatisfaction when overbooking strategies are implemented. Understanding and anticipating booking cancellations is therefore essential for optimizing operations and maintaining a balance between revenue goals and guest satisfaction.

This project focuses on developing a machine-learning model to predict which guests are likely to cancel their bookings. By leveraging historical booking data and identifying key patterns, the model aims to provide actionable insights for hotel chains, helping them make informed decisions about resource allocation, overbooking strategies, and marketing efforts to retain at-risk customers.
