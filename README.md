# Hotel Cancellation Machine Learning

## Project Description:

This project was completed as an assignment for BUS 458 at North Carolina State University. It was developed collaboratively with two other group members to demonstrate proficiency in machine learning techniques, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. The project focused on predicting hotel bookings using a dataset that required thoughtful exploration and feature engineering to address real-world challenges in the hospitality industry.

#### **Background**
Efficient capacity management is a critical aspect of success for hotel chains. Unexpected cancellations can disrupt operations, result in revenue losses from underbooking, and cause customer dissatisfaction when overbooking strategies are implemented. Therefore, understanding and anticipating booking cancellations is essential for optimizing operations and maintaining a balance between revenue goals and guest satisfaction.

This project focuses on developing a machine-learning model to predict which guests are likely to cancel their bookings. By leveraging historical booking data and identifying key patterns, the model aims to provide actionable insights for hotel chains, helping them make informed decisions about resource allocation, overbooking strategies, and marketing efforts to retain at-risk customers.
